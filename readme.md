# Group Level Cohesion

## Abstract
Cohesiveness of a group is an essential indicator of emotional state, structure and success of a group of people. We study the factors that influence the perception of group level cohesion and propose methods for estimating the human-perceived cohesion on the Group Cohesiveness Scale (GCS). Based on the Group Affect database, we add GCS and propose the 'GAF-Cohesion database'.  It is interesting to note that GCS as an attribute, when jointly trained for group level emotion prediction, helps in increasing the performance for the later task. This suggests that group level emotion and GCS are correlated.
